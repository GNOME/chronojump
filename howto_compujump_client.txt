- mono 3.2.8 does not work on compujumps by multiple gtk problems. Updated using mono from website. Version: 5.8.0
- apt-get install mono-devel mono-complete
- compilation ok, but on autogen there were problems with System.Data.dll 4.0, but it was impossible to fix. So this have been done:

Howto run compujump client.
Instructions for 1.7.0-390.
Has to be done on this exact order:

0) Have a Linux machine
1) Assign permissions for Chronopic (changing 'username' for desired username)

# usermod -a -G dialout username

Close the session (reboot?) in order to ensure that the permissions are assigned. Check with:

$groups

2) Install Chronojump from GIT: http://chronojump.org/en/linux-compile/
3) Connect RFID
4) Open Chronojump (database will be created) and identify RFID device
5) Connect Encoder or photocels
6) Go to Jumps / device and identify device
7) On encoder clients go to encoder... Select desired encoder configuration (need a user for this!)
8) Close Chronojump

9) Install sqlite3
10) delete encoder exercises!!! important to not have conflict with upcoming exercises from server

11) Delete existing test types:

$ sqlite3 .local/share/Chronojump/chronojump.db

11a) if the station will be encoder:
delete from encoderExercise;

note also there should not be encoder tests captured, if you are unsure:

delete from encoder;
delete from uploadEncoderDataTemp;

11b) if the station will be runInterval:
delete runInterval exercises. And Add these:

delete from runIntervalType;
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(1, "5 m", 5.0, 1, 1, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(2, "10 m", 5.0, 1, 2, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(3, "15 m", 5.0, 1, 3, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(4, "20 m", 5.0, 1, 4, 0, "", "");

note also there should not be run interval tests captured, if you are unsure:

delete from runInterval
delete from uploadSprintDataTemp;

12) also ensure there are no persons

select * from person77;
select * from personSession77;

can be deleted with:

delete from person77;
delete from personSession77;

.quit

13) Copy this chronojump_config.txt on .local/share/Chronojump

#Session modes:
SessionMode=MONTHLY

#Use Compujump
Compujump=TRUE

#if is Django uncomment this line:
CompujumpDjango=TRUE

CompujumpServerURL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
CompujumpStationID=1

#CompujumpStationMode, modes:
#RUNSINTERVALLIC, POWERGRAVITATORY, POWERINERTIAL
#will start on this mode and could not be changed
CompujumpStationMode=POWERGRAVITATORY

14) Change CompujumpServerURL or CompujumpStationID or CompujumpStationMode.
    Remember SPACES are NOT allowed immediatelly before or after '='
15) Open Chronojump
16) Select preferences (Encoder capture main variable (mean speed?), font size..)

17) Config client backups
     mkdir /home/chronojump/backups
     mkdir /home/chronojump/backups/Chronojump
     crontab -e
     0 3 * * * rsync -a -r --delete /home/chronojump/.local/share/Chronojump/ /home/chronojump/backups/Chronojump/

18) Config mail sending (config_mail.sh)
