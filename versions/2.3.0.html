	<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-area-chart fa-2x"></i>  General Chronojump changes</span></p>
	<ul>
	All the software new graphs (Cairo) are much faster now (draw is done first to a surface).
	Interactive graphs show a mouse icon (meaning that can be clicked).
	Updated Windows Chronopic drivers CDM21228 -> CDM212364 (2021-07-15)
	More height for gui import results (to allow showing any error message).
	When another person is selected all the graphs get blank to not display data of another person.
	</ul>

	<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-running fa-2x"></i>  Race analyzer</span></p>
	<ul>
	Fixed occasional duplicated values on import race analyzer data.
	</ul>

	<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-2x"></i>  Jumps, Races</span></p>
	<ul>
	<b>Improvements on linked selection of graphs</b> Selecting a jump or race on the bottom/left graph, selects it on the table and it shows on the top graph (for jumps multiple and intervallic races). Selecting on the table it also shows on the top.
		<li><b>Jumps</b></li>
		<ul>
			jump/races data table show datetime in YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
		</ul>
		<li><b>Races</b></li>
		<ul>
			Capture graph show no spaces between bars to express the continuity.
			On WICHRO the photocell number that cuts each of the phases is shown on capture graph at edge of each bar (and gets stored for being shown when selected).
			Red photocells running mark, show photocell number on WICHRO.
			Fixed distance, time, speed labels in agility tests graphs since moved to Cairo.
			Fixed crash on select "unlimited" race test. 
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-bar-chart fa-2x"></i>  Encoder</span></p>i
	<ul>
	<b>Realtime capture line graph and bars are now done by Cairo.</b>
	Improvements on encoder configuration actions: edit, duplicate, ...
	Encoder analyze can filter repetitions by laterality.
	Preferences encoder can select criteria for best ecc-con repetition, and stored meanPower, meanSpeed, meanForce is according to this criteria.
	Encoder overview reps show meanSpeed, meanForce, meanPower (previously only show meanPower)
	Encoder overview shows the contraction and the criteria.
	Fixed sometimes awkward value of spin_encoder_im_weights_n (number of inertial weights) and label_encoder_displaced_weight (displaced weight)
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<b>Networks (encoder) now how as Guest button to be used by persons without wristband/account</b>. Data is not uploaded, not stored, use main speed, disables some widgets.
