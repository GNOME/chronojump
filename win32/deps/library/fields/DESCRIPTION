Description: Fields is for curve, surface and function fitting with an
        emphasis on splines, spatial data and spatial statistics. The
        major methods include cubic, robust, and thin plate splines,
        and Kriging for large data sets. The splines and Kriging
        methods are supporting by functions that can determine the
        smoothing parameter (nugget and sill variance) by cross
        validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood.  A major
        feature is that any covariance function implemented in R with
        the fields interface can be used for spatial prediction. Some
        tailored optimization functions are supplied for find the MLEs
        for the Matern family of covariances.  There are also many
        useful functions for plotting and working with spatial data as
        images. This package also contains an implementation of a
        sparse matrix methods for large data sets and currently
        requires the sparse matrix (spam) package for testing (but not
        for the standard spatial functions.) Use help(fields) to get
        started and for an overview.  The fields source code is heavily
        commented and should provide useful explanation of numerical
        details in addition to the manual pages.
