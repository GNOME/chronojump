on graph.R at ! singleFile curves are created by start/end,
on ecS con starts just after ecc end
and some executions (like on curve1.txt)
ecc con need to be separated

From 25 Apr 2023 it will use reduceCurveBySpeed like on singleFile to have same data on analysis when processing different repetitions
From 3 May 2023 do it with the getCurvesStartEnd.R process (on util.cs is: reduceCurveByPredictStartEnd() )
