Updated until 5 May (included)


Changes since 2.1.1-16 (2021 March 16)

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-area-chart fa-2x"></i>  General Chronojump changes</span></p>
<ul>
<b>Top left selectors to change fast from:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>jump simple to reactive.</b></li>
<li><b>races simple, races intervallic, race analyzer.</b></li>
<li><b>gravitatory encoder, inertial encoder.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>On session load window you can see/hide the number or persons on that session and the number of each type of tests, by default tests or current mode are shown.</b>
<b>Now load session shows results much faster, specially when is shown again (2nd, 3rd, ... times).<b>
<b>A session can be edited and deleted from session load window.</b>
After importing a session to a new session, allows to load it in the same dialog.
If import file path is very long, it is displayed with dots in the middle.
All Chronojump exercises can be selected with left/right buttons (better for tactile screens) (previously it was only on encoder, now is in jumps, races, race analyzer, force sensor and encoder).
Now application title is: Chronojump - mode - session name.
Fixed some displaying color problems on generic windows depending on user selected background color.
Improvements on person select window (when persons are on top).
Exporting a session can be cancelled by the user (if there is any problem or it is slow).
Fixed highlighting always latest products icon when there is no network.
Improved person add/edit window.
Fixed bug on triggers on analyze graphs when there are ON and not OFF or viceversa.
Ensure widgets sensitivity of all the widgets is correctly applied when load a session without persons.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-area-chart fa-2x"></i>  Force sensor</span></p>
<ul>
<b>Capture options do not show: normal/abs/inverted on ForceResultant (is always ABS).</b>
<b>Exercises can show repetitions: concentric, concenctric + eccentric together or separeted.</b>
<b>Fixed variability: cvRMSSD (needed sqrt and dividing by mean) (and also *100 to be percentage).</b>
<b>Fixed capture with triggers.</b>
Analyze graph shows triggers also in zoom.
Import session also imports forceSensor triggers.
Analyze graph fixed the X on triggers (was not exactly at place).
Exercise dialog has same window size for all the tabs (so clicking in next is not annoying anymore with the bottom buttons being moved all the time).
Do not allow to forceSensor capture if no session or no person.
Ensure button_execute_test is not active after adjust if there are no persons.
RFD-back button much clear with an icon.
After load ensure change to signal (not rfd image).
Shown triggers on analyze.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-bar-chart fa-2x"></i>  Encoder</span></p>
<ul>
<b>Now Encoder configuration and exercises are different for gravitatory than inertial. An exercise can be gravitatory, inertial or both. Related changes:</b>
<ul>
<li>button encoder config: shows gravitatory or inertia on label depending on mode.</li>
<li>Exercise edit takes care on saved sets with that exercise.</li>
<li>Displayed help button on gravitatory/inertial config problems like changing this modes on some exercise but having some sets captured on the other mode.</li>
</ul>
Fixed wrong title "Delete exercise" on exercise edit.
Fixed trigger on encoder.
Fixed potentially bugs on select.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-running fa-2x"></i>  Race analyzer</span></p>
<ul>
<b>On Capture (realtime) and load, apart from a speedometer, is also shows now graphs of: speed/time, position/time, accel/time.</b>
On export, lap times are also exported.
Speedometer shows results in two lines: Max speed and distance (also on load).
Now on load it does not change automatically to analyze tab because graphs on capture tab are relevant.
On load analyze is not automatic now. User will need to click on analyze button.
Can capture with person height == 0 (undefined), and shows an informative message.
Improvements on user interface on top right of analyze tab.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-2x"></i>  Jumps, Races</span></p>
<ul>
<b>Last Jump simple or multiple configuration is remembered when Chronojump is closed. Work faster and avoid mistake. Example of variables remembered: Sjl weight, Dj fall number of jumps, number of seconds, ...</b>
<b>Fixed ending of RSA tests since last versions, now end time is ok.<b>
<b>Sprints can be exported like forceSensor and RaceAnalyzer (all the sprints of a person or all the sprints on the session) Includes images and table (spreadsheet data). Export includes laps</b>
<b>Datetime is shown in races,a also on export.</b>
<b>On jumps multiple results table, it is shown now also the average of power and stiffness.</b>.
<b>Simple races new analyze graph: Races/time. This graph can be saved, it can show all or only best in session, can show speed or time, km/h or m/s, has a selector for tests with custom (selectable) distances (and remember these in preferences).</b>
Intervallic race types with different distances allow 5 characters: eg 25,51. So now decimal values are available on this tipe or races.
Better animation on moving bar of last simple jump / simple race done. Animation according elapsed time.
Shown decimal separator character on adding a new run type.
Jump fall entry button  has now 1 decimal.
Fixed not showing track distance on creating new simple run type.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-sitemap fa-2x"></i>  Chronojump-networks</span></p>
<ul>
Can change between jumps modes.
Fixed not showing "disconnected rfid" if disconnect it after an encoder capture.
Improvements on downloading image of each player and identification in general.
Fixed lowercase month names on some systems.
Now encoderDataTemp is not uploaded.
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight2"><i class="fa fa-flag-o fa-2x"></i>  Translations</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Slovenian, Spanish, Urkainian.</li>
</ul>
