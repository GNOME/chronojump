* Arch/Manjaro:

if we use gtk3, it would be:
$ sudo pacman -S glade

BUT glade-gtk3 use GTK3 and this is only gtkbuilder and we need libglade, so we nee:

https:://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glade-gtk2

do:

$ git clone https:://aur.archlinux.org/packages/glade-gtk2
makepkg fails, it needs: python2 gobject-introspection python2-gobject2 gtk-doc

$ sudo pacman -S python2 gobject-introspection python2-gobject2 gtk-doc

makepkg and install with:
makepkg -si 

* pop_os 20.04

https://download.gnome.org/sources/glade3/3.8/

autogen seems to want:
sudo apt install gnome-common
https://download.gnome.org/sources/gtk-doc/
xsltproc

but configure has enough with:

sudo apt install itstool libgladeui-2-6
./configure
sudo make install
