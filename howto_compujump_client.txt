Howto run compujump client.
Instructions for 1.7.0-390.
Has to be done on this exact order:

0) Have a Linux machine
1) Assign permissions for Chronopic (changing 'username' for desired username)

# usermod -a -G dialout username

Close the session (reboot?) in order to ensure that the permissions are assigned. Check with:

$groups

2) Install Chronojump from GIT: http://chronojump.org/en/linux-compile/
3) Connect RFID
4) Open Chronojump (database will be created) and identify RFID device
5) Connect Encoder or photocels
6) Go to Jumps / device and identify device
7) On encoder clients go to encoder... Select desired encoder configuration (need a user for this!)
8) Close Chronojump

9) Install sqlite3
10) delete encoder exercises!!! important to not have conflict with upcoming exercises from server

$ sqlite3 .local/share/Chronojump/chronojump.db
delete from encoderExercise;

11) if the station will be runInterval:
delete runInterval exercises. And Add these:

delete from runIntervalType;
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(1, "5 m", 5.0, 1, 1, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(2, "10 m", 5.0, 1, 2, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(3, "15 m", 5.0, 1, 3, 0, "", "");
insert into runIntervalType VALUES(4, "20 m", 5.0, 1, 4, 0, "", "");

12) also ensure there are no persons

select * from person77;
select * from personSession77;

.quit

13) Copy this chronojump_config.txt on .local/share/Chronojump

#Session modes:
SessionMode=MONTHLY

#Use Compujump
Compujump=TRUE
CompujumpServerURL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
CompujumpStationID=1

#CompujumpStationMode, modes:
#JUMPSSIMPLE, JUMPSREACTIVE, RUNSSIMPLE, RUNSINTERVALLIC, POWERGRAVITATORY, POWERINERTIAL, FORCESENSOR, RT, OTHER
#will start on this mode and could not be changed
CompujumpStationMode=POWERGRAVITATORY

14) Change CompujumpServerURL or CompujumpStationID or CompujumpStationMode.
    Remember SPACES are NOT allowed immediatelly before or after '='
15) Open Chronojump
16) Select preferences (Encoder capture main variable (mean speed?), font size..)
